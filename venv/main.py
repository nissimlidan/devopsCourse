# (1)
a = 7
b = 44.3
print(a+b)
print(a*b)
print(b/a)

# (2)
# #a,b,c will be ... at the end
# a = 9, b = 8, c = 15

# (3)
# There is no difference between "john" and 'john', both strings

# (4)
# In this way only strings can be added, if we want to print INT we will have to use the f format
my_number = 5+5
print(f'result is: {my_number}')

# (5)
# As soon as you put flout into int, the number will become a number without a decimal point, so the answer is 7(5+2)

# (6)
a = 8
b = "123"
print(a + int(b))
